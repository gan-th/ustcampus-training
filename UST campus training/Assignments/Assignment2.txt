Why we cannnot call the local variable from outside ?
	We cannot call the local variable from outside because, it imporves the security of the
program as some variables cannot be accessed outside its scope. A scope of a local variable is 
inside it's function. A global variable can be accessed from anywhere inside our program. It 
also makes the management of memory more efficient.

Where to use filter, map and reduce function ?
	Filter functions can be used to filter out certain values from an iterable like
lists. Map function is used to perform certain task like adding a value to it,
multiplying every element by a number and so on to every elements in the iterable.
Reduce function is used to reduce all the elements in the iterable to a single 
value such as calculating the sum of all the elements or product of all the 
elements. Map returns an iterable of the same size. Filter returns an iterable
that has size less than or equal to the original list. Reduce returns a single value.
